# Description

Have you ever watched a movie in a foreign language and thought "I wish I could do that!"

Well, now you can!

This project has two parts. One is for the teachers to create a dialog from a video (audio) clip. The other is for the students to practice. The teacher's section "Dialogs" because they create dialogs for students to follow. The students' section is called "Echoes" because they echo the audio they hear.

# Feature Roadmap

* A class management tool for teachers to organize thier classes and assignments
* A grading section for teachers to give feedback.
* A way to pair with others in the class to work on a dialog with a partner.
* Real-time machine assisted feedback to students on the voice recordings.
